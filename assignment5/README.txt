Import IO
=========

* Document Model (DOM, Text, anything in addition to these) 


  
* Form Filling and Macro Recording

Quite natural I think. You navigate to the connector and can then start to record
the form filling. Having seen the Lixto Visual Developer this is very restricted
and there not much to configure.

* Transform original tree structure

* Natural Language Processing Support

* Heuristics and Rule Generation

Sometimes the recognistion of some rules does not work very well with only a few examples.
It sometimes takes put to 5 examples until the recognition of the attribute is learned.
But as far as I have worked with import.io it is very robust after it is correct.

* Image Recognition

Images are handled quite nice. When selecting them as a attribute of the output they
are displayed directly.

* Scripting

While the rule learning is in progress there is not many parameters you can tweak.
But when the rules are completed you can access a very rich API in alot of different
languages to aquire the data.

* Ajax Support and DOM Freezing, DOM Event Support 

At first it always tries not to use the javascript engine. There are alot of dialogs
asking you "Does the site look as expected?". If not it is reloaded with javascript enabled.
This I think is quite good idea in terms of resources.

* Input and Output Formats

Rich set of outputs. The wrapped data can be downloaded as EXCEL,HTML,JSON or CSV and
by exposing a REST API those can be processed by any programming language.

* Control Browser Settings like User Agent 
* Parameterization

Can be specified when the is fetched from the REST API. This is quite conveinient.

* Iteration, Conditions, Loops



* Robustness and Adaptation
* Automated Steps, Machine Learning (from multiple examples) 
* Storing screenshots / html source to file system

I don't think this is implemented in import.io.

* Performance and Scalability

Decent. Compared to open dapper it is a little faster.

* Ease of Use


* Proxy Variations


* Captcha Support

I don't think there is captcha support.

* Execution Environment
